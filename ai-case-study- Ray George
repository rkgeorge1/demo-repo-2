## Overview and Origin

* Teladoc Health Inc.

* Teladoc was founded in 2002 in Dallas, Texas by G. Byron Brooks EE MD and Michael Gorton. Billing itself as the oldest telemedicine company in United States,

* Teladoc's initial business model allowed patients to remotely consult with state-licensed doctors at any time. In particular, Teladoc Health uses telephone and videoconferencing software as well as mobile apps to provide on-demand remote medical care. Teladoc has leveraged AI to streamline and optimize various aspects of healthcare delivery and clinical documentation. Intelligent automation, powered by Microsoft’s AI technologies, is expected to enhance the efficiency of administrative tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care and less on paperwork.

* Teladoc is a publicly teaded company under teh symbol TDOC

## Business Activities

* In the face of an ongoing global healthcare workforce crisis and the shortage of clinicians, there was a need to reduce the administrative burden on the existing healthcare workforce and enhance the efficiency of administrative tasks, thereby allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care and less on paperwork.
The healthcare industry has long been grappling with challenges related to workforce shortages and an overwhelming demand for medical services. In recent times, this crisis has only intensified, driven by various factors such as an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic diseases, and, most notably, the global COVID-19 pandemic. As healthcare providers strive to meet the mounting demands, the need for innovative solutions has become more urgent than ever, especially when it comes to administrative burdens put on clinicians. This shift will also improve overall patient experiences

* The intended customer base are Fortune 500 employers, as well as thousands of small businesses, labor unions, and public-sector employers, Hospitals and health systems, Global Insurers and individual patients.
The global telemedicine market size was valued at $87.41 billion in 2022 & is projected to grow from $94.44 billion in 2023 to $286.22 billion by 2030.

* Teladoc Health Inc. holds a leading position in the market by collaborating with other market leaders such as Microsoft’s healthcare division. A large customer base, an established network of GPs & specialists, and strategic collaborations are the major factors that have helped the company dominate this industry.
The partnership with Microsoft’s AI technologies provides a competitive advantage in the telemedicine marketplace. Teladoc announced is collaborating with Microsoft to combine its delivery platform for hospitals and health systems with Microsoft Teams.[58] Teladoc introduced its primary care service Primary360 on a national scale in October 2021. The program gave members access to both a primary physician and care team, with a system in place for follow up reminders about appointments and personal maintenance.
In February 2022, Teladoc Health launched Chronic Care Complete, a program to help patients manage multiple chronic conditions. Early testing suggests these AI note-taking solutions produce documentation that is both accurate and coherent. This efficiency would allow doctors, nurses, and other providers to devote more of their limited time to direct patient care rather than administrative tasks. Just as importantly, it helps combat documentation burnout.

* Teladoc is using Intelligent automation, powered by Microsoft’s AI technologies. Microsoft will integrate AI and clinical documentation technology, like Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Cognitive Services, and the Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience™ (DAX™) to its Teladoc Health Solo™ virtual care platform. The integrated solutions will automate the creation of clinical documentation during virtual exams to help ease the burden on the healthcare workforce while improving the quality of shared medical information and the care it supports. The Teladoc Health Medical Group also plans to use Nuance DAX Express for care visits provided directly by Teladoc Health.
Teladoc collaborated with Amazon for users to access Teladoc through Alexa[61]and related voice-activated devices such as the Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Show.

## Landscape

* Teladoc operates broadly in the Telehealth industry. Telehealth is the distribution of health-related services and information via electronic information and telecommunication technologies. It allows long-distance patient and clinician contact, care, advice, reminders, education, intervention, monitoring, and remote admissions. Telemedicine is sometimes used as a synonym, or is used in a more limited sense to describe remote clinical services, such as diagnosis and monitoring. When rural settings, lack of transport, a lack of mobility, conditions due to outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, decreased funding, or a lack of staff restrict access to care, telehealth may bridge the gap[4] as well as provide distance-learning; meetings, supervision, and presentations between practitioners; online information and health data management and healthcare system integration. Telehealth could include two clinicians discussing a case over video conference; a robotic surgery occurring through remote access; physical therapy done via digital monitoring instruments, live feed and application combinations; tests being forwarded between facilities for interpretation by a higher specialist; home monitoring through continuous sending of patient health data; client to practitioner online conference; or even videophone interpretation during a consult.

* In the 2010s, integration of smart home telehealth technologies, such as health and wellness devices, software, and integrated IoT, has accelerated the industry. Healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting the use of self-tracking and cloud-based technologies, and innovative data analytic approaches to accelerate telehealth delivery.
Enhancing Patient-Provider Interactions
Beyond documentation, AI has promising applications throughout the telehealth experience that could make virtual visits more productive and personalized. For example, as telehealth scales rapidly, healthcare systems are seeing a flood of new patients interacting with providers who lack full knowledge of their medical history. AI algorithms can scan electronic health records to create quick patient profiles that give clinicians the context they need in the moment to deliver effective episodic care.
Additionally, natural language processing enables AI assistants to listen in on telehealth consultations. These assistants can then suggest relevant follow-up questions to providers in real time to improve diagnosis and treatment. As the technology advances, AI even holds the potential to flag potential health concerns that the provider does not directly ask about.
One of the core promises of telehealth is improving healthcare access and convenience for patients. AI stands to further these advantages. For one, integrating AI scheduling assistants and chatbots onto telehealth platforms can make booking appointments faster and simpler. Patients may even be able to schedule visits outside of regular business hours when primary care offices are closed. Once in a visit, AI evaluation and triage tools can reduce appointment length for minor concerns by quickly gathering basic health information. This would allow providers to see more patients in less time, increasing access
Looking ahead, we are still just scratching the surface of what AI can do for healthcare and telehealth. Microsoft's acquisition of AI pioneer OpenAI reflects the massive investments that tech leaders are making into the space. As these systems grow more advanced, AI diagnosticians may one day be able to independently handle routine health concerns without a human provider in the loop. AI robots could even conduct physical exams virtually under a provider's supervision. Further down the line, predictive algorithms may give patients personalized warnings about potential health risks.
Of course, there are still significant technical limitations and privacy concerns. However, the pace of advancement shows that AI is poised to revolutionize how we provide, receive, and think about healthcare. The integration into telehealth is only the beginning. This presents huge opportunities to increase quality, access, and affordability. But it also raises questions about the ideal balance between technology and human providers. If thoughtfully implemented, AI can complement clinicians rather than outright replacing them. The Teladoc and Microsoft collaboration represents an early model of humans and machines working together to make virtual care more efficient and effective.

Rising Number of E-Visits to Boost Demand for Real-time Telehealth Solutions
On the basis of modality, the market is segmented into real-time, Store-and-Forward (S&F), and others.
The real-time segment is expected to witness lucrative growth owing to the drastic rise in the number of e-visits. According to the On-demand Virtual Care Benchmark Survey, 32.1% of doctors in the U.S. had an on-demand virtual care service in 2018. This is likely to propel the growth of the real-time segment.
The increasing application of telehealth in the diagnosis of diseases, especially in dermatology and radiology, is expected to favor the expansion of the store-and-forward segment. Moreover, the rising internet penetration, even in rural areas, coupled with a significant increase in the number of smartphone users, is projected to augment the growth of the others segment.
Industry Segmentation by Application Analysis
High Demand for Diagnostic and Image Interpretation Services to Spur Adoption of Teleradiology Services.
Based on application, the market is fragmented into teleradiology, telepathology, telecardiology, telepsychiatry, teledermatology, and others.
The teleradiology segment dominated the market in 2022 and is expected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. Factors attributable to the expansion of this segment are advancements in Store-and-Forward (S&F) technologies and dearth of radiologists in rural areas. According to the Canada Association of Radiologists (CAR), there will be a need for 1,700 new radiologists during the period of 2019-2040. This factor is expected to drive the teleradiology segment.
The increasing demand for digital health products and services for behavioral health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is a key factor expanding the telepsychiatry segment. As per the Excellus BlueCross BlueShield survey, 22% of the e-visits made by the Excellus BlueCross BlueShield members in 2018 in the U.S. were for behavioral health, which included conditions, such as bipolar disorders, attention disorders, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, in October 2022, the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of India rolled out tele-mental health services across the nation. The network consisted of 23 tele-mental health centers of excellence, which will work with the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS).
The rapid adoption of remote cardiac monitoring devices and m-health apps for tracking the heart and pulse rate is a prominent factor augmenting the growth of the telecardiology segment. The increasing number of dermatology visits and rising demand for dermatoscopes are likely to propel the teledermatology segment growth. The surging telemedicine applications in urology, neurology, chronic diseases, and others are also expected to propel the growth of the segment.
Industry Segmentation by End User Analysis
Increasing Number of Government Initiatives to Boost the Adoption of Telemedicine among Healthcare Facilities. In terms of end user, the market is segmented into healthcare facilities, homecare, and others.

## Results

* Financials and Performance Metrics
Telaodoc's 2023 revenue grew 8% to $2.6 billion from $2.4 billion a year ago. The company's integrated care segment brought in revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% from a year ago, and BetterHelp revenue jumped 11% to reach $1.1 billion in 2023.
Teladoc reported a fourth quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA increase of 22% to $114 million, and full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA grew 33% to $328 million.
Teladoc CEO Jason Gorevic noted that the adjusted EBITDA for the direct-to-consumer mental health business BetterHelp increased 11% to $58 million in the fourth quarter and was up 19% to $136 million for the full year.
Teladoc offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for 2024, projecting slower revenue growth as the telehealth market has become crowded with digital health players. The company projected pfirst-quarter revenue in the range of $630 million to $645 million, short of the analysts' projections of $673 million. It also expects an EPS loss between 55 cents and 45 cents, worse than the consensus projection of a loss of 43 cents per share.

* The virtual care giant pulled in $661 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 4% from $638 million in the same period a year ago. Access fees revenue grew 4% to $574 million, and other revenue grew 3% to $87 million. U.S. revenue grew 2% to $565 million, and international revenue grew 15% to $96 million.
The company's BetterHelp virtual mental health business saw flat growth in the fourth quarter, bringing in $277 million. The weakness in BetterHelp sales was the result of lower direct-to-consumer marketing yield. Teladoc's integrated care segment—its virtual care business aimed at health plans, employers and health systems—brought in $384 million, up 8% from last year, according to Teladoc's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report.
For the full year of 2024, Teladoc expects revenue to range between $2.635 billion and $2.735 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $2.77 billion for the year. It also forecasts EPS loss between $1.10 and 80 cents, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.23. The company also projects integrated care membership to reach between 90 million and 92 million members.

* Half of Teladoc's integrated care segment revenue is primarily comprised of its chronic condition management segment and its international virtual care business. "Our general medical virtual urgent care book of business, including our 90 million members, represent a long runway for continued cross-selling of our chronic care products as we execute against our land and expand strategy," Gorevic said.
"About 16% of our general medical client base has access to one or more of our chronic care products today. That's up from just 12% two years ago. While we made a lot of progress over the last two years, with 16% penetration, there's still a long runway for chronic care growth within our existing virtual care," he noted.

## Recommendations

* Introduction of AI-based Clinics would be an opportunity for Teladoc to explore.

* Teladoc has a large client base with 90 million members that provides a "steady source of revenue," Gorevic said, but, he noted, the virtual care market has become saturated. "It's important to remember that most U.S. healthcare consumers have access to virtual urgent care today, so it's largely a replacement market at this point. We've consistently taken share in this market and we expect to continue to do so but it's fairly well penetrated. And accordingly, we anticipate revenue growth for our U.S. virtual care product will be in the low single digits going forward," he told investors. This is a growth issue for Teladoc.

* Artificial Intelligence-powered booths have emerged in local malls in the past few years. The system includes a smart medicine cabinet that can dispense more than 100 medications. Ping An Good Doctor announced the launch of a tiny unstaffed clinic that incorporated Artificial Intelligence (AI). Patients who required immediate consultations could sit in the three-square meter booth and consult with a doctor, which functioned through AI.
The AI machine collects the patient’s medical history and provides a diagnosis strategy, which will then be transferred to a clinical expert. These miniature clinics are called “One-Minute Clinics.” These clinics can then connect patients with a clinician on Ping An Good Doctor’s in-house medical team. Such AI-based clinics can be set up anywhere from schools to shopping malls and pharmacies to highway service stations.
Additionally, in February 2023, Vitalchat launched AI-enabled E-Sitter to transform inpatient telehealth for hospitals. This solution is powered by voice and movement, offering hands-free technology. Hence, such innovations in digital health offer tremendous opportunities for the market to exhibit a positive growth trajectory during the forecast period.
San Francisco-based health tech startup Forward, uses healthcare pods malls across the country. Rather than the more traditional primary care that Forward offers at these clinics, the CarePod is an attempt to fully automate a check-up: A patient approaches the metallic, square 8x8 foot box, which is eight feet by eight feet, and unlocks it with their phone. Once inside, they find a chair and a large screen, where a robotic voice walks them through a body scan or blood pressure reading or finger prick blood draws — all of which they do on their own.

* Teladoc is well positioned and would be a benefit from either developing their own AI based clinics or invest in companies or technologies such as Ping An, Vitalchat and Forward to grow their AI based business model.
